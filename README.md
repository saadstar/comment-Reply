Hi,There 
this is part1 (intervirew)

in this project i have build the side server-side and client-side 
maybe it's easy to deal with api's by a redux or any local state mangement but i perfered to do it with node.js and store data in mongooDB (to show my skills) becouse we belive in good quality i am a front-end developer who can build a fullstack (front&back-end) 





#### how to Start the Project
1-download the repo from github : https://github.com/saadstar/Part1
2- open two terminals  ()
 a-  cd api ===> npm install ====> npm run dev
 a-  cd client ===> npm install ====> npm start
   


   ##### responsive 
   maybe the resposivity br not the perfect but that becouse i was have notime to do so 

   ######used library 
   back-end: express cors express-async-handler mongoose
   front-end: bootstrap fontawesom redux
